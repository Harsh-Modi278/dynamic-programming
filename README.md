# About Dynamic Programming
**Dynamic Programming** is a problem-solving technique for solving a problem by breaking it into similar subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure. Each of the subproblem solutions is indexed in some way, typically based on the values of its input parameters, so as to facilitate its lookup. So the next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time. This technique of storing solutions to subproblems instead of recomputing them is called memoization.

There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: **optimal substructure** and **overlapping sub-problems**. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems, the strategy is called **divide and conquer** instead. This is why merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems.
