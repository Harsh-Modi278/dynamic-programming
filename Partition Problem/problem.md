# Problem
In number theory and computer science, the partition problem, or number partitioning, is the task of deciding whether a given multiset S of positive integers can be partitioned into two subsets S1 and S2 such that the sum of the numbers in S1 equals the sum of the numbers in S2.

For example:

Consider S = {3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1}

We can partition S into two partitions, each having a sum of 5.

S1 = {1, 1, 1, 2}
S2 = {2, 3}

Note that this solution is not unique. Hereâ€™s another solution.

S1 = {3, 1, 1}
S2 = {2, 2, 1}

## Sample
### Input
```
S = [3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]
```
### Output
```
YES
// S can be partitioned
```
