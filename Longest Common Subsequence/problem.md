# Problem
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

For example, consider the sequences (ABCD) and (ACBAD). They have 5 length-2 common subsequences: (AB), (AC), (AD), (BD), and (CD); 2 length-3 common subsequences: (ABD) and (ACD); and no longer common subsequences. So (ABD) and (ACD) are their longest common subsequences.

## Sample
### Input
```
ABCBDAB
BDCABA
```

### Output
```
BCAB, BCBA, BDAB
