# Problem
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted `Fn`, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`.

The sequense starts as:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
```
```
F0 = 1
F1 = 1
Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2) (n > 1)
```

Print the `nth` number of the Fibonacci Sequence

## Sample
### Input
```
10
```

### Output
```
55
